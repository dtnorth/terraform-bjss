# 📸 AWS Image Management Platform

This demo project is a **full-stack image management platform** deployed on AWS. 

It allows users to **upload, manage, change image resolution, share and access images** whilst allowing for security, cost management, minimal app footprint and handles spikes in the apps usage utilising:

- **CloudFront CDN** UI presentation
  
- **AWS S3 Storage** All Image and Terraform state / Terraform lock file storage
  
- **AWS API Gateway** Routes User Requests to AWS Lambda and Provides a Public HTTP API, Secures API Requests and caches responses
  to reduce unnecessary Lambda executions whilst supporting rate limiting to prevent API abuse

- **AWS DynamoDB** Image metadata and Terraform State
  
- **AWS Lambda**
  
```plaintext
User uploads an image via an API call (POST / UI upload).
API Gateway routes request to image_upload_lambda.
image_upload_lambda: Saves the original image in S3.

- Calls image_resize_lambda to create multiple sizes to user resolution specification.
- Calls url_shortener_lambda to generate a short link.

User retrieves the image using a shortened URL (GET /short/{id}) via UI.
CloudFront serves the images globally for fast performance.
```
- **NodeJS**
  
```plaintext
User uploads an image via API Gateway (POST /upload).
API Gateway routes request to AWS Lambda, which is running Node.js (Express.js).
Node.js (Express.js) in AWS Lambda:

Uses NodeJS Multer to process file uploads.
Saves original image in Amazon S3.
Calls NodeJSsharp to create resized images.
Calls AWS DynamoDB to store short URLs.
Node.js sends JSON response back to API Gateway with:
- Original image URL
- Resized image URLs
- Shortened URL
```
- **Github Actions**
```plaintext

- Code Checkout	and branch creation fetches the latest version of the repository
- Terraform Security Scan (tfsec)	Checks for security misconfigurations in Terraform based on the inhouse configuration of allowable practises in the tools config file.
- Cost Estimation (Infracost)	Estimates AWS infrastructure cost before deployment based on the inhouse configuration of allowable practises in the tools config file.
- Terraform Apply	Deploys AWS infrastructure (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- Build & Package Lambda	Installs NodeJS dependencies and creates lambda.zip
- Upload Lambda to S3	Stores the ZIP package in an S3 bucket
- Update Lambda Code	Deploys the latest function version to AWS
- CloudFront Cache Invalidation	ensures the latest frontend is served whilst only invalidating changed code in the cache to ensure cost minimisation.
```
- **AWS Serverless Scaling**
```plaintext
  🚀 Scenario: A Sudden Surge in Image Uploads
- A user uploads an image, triggering POST /upload.
- API Gateway forwards the request to AWS Lambda.
- AWS Lambda runs the function and processes the image.
- More users upload images, so AWS Lambda scales automatically:
- Starts with zero instances.
- Scales up to multiple instances if traffic increases.
- Scales down to zero when demand drops.
- DynamoDB scales up to handle more shortened URL lookups.
- S3 stores all images, handling high traffic automatically.
- CloudFront caches images, reducing the need for redundant Lambda invocations.

✅ Result: The system scales without downtime or manual intervention!
```
- **Cloudwatch**
```plaintext
  🚀 Scenario: Monitoring a High-Traffic Image Upload
- User uploads an image via API Gateway (POST /upload).
- API Gateway logs the request in CloudWatch.
- AWS Lambda runs the function, and CloudWatch records execution time, errors, and memory usage.
- If Lambda execution time exceeds x seconds, CloudWatch triggers an alert via SNS (Email, Slack, etc.).
- DynamoDB auto-scales, and CloudWatch logs throughput usage.
- CloudFront caches images, and CloudWatch tracks cache hit rates.

✅ Result: Real-time monitoring of system performance and automatic scaling adjustments.
```
The entire infrastructure is automated with **Terraform**, while **GitHub Actions** in this example ensures continuous deployment upon successful
workflow consideration of the **github actions** pull request review, ##tfsec static analysis## to defined guidelines and ##Infracost## infrastructure AWS costing steps.

For simplicity and cost reduction no VPC, EC2, ECS OR EKS or traditional cloud structures are required.

The architecture is optimized for **cost-effectiveness**, **performance optimisation utilizing AWS's free-tier offerings and minimizing unnecessary expense.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Overview

### **Frontend (Next.js + S3 + CloudFront)**
- The Next.js application is **statically exported** and stored in **S3**.
- CloudFront serves the site globally with **HTTPS & caching**, reducing bandwidth costs.
- **S3 Lifecycle policies** ensure old, unused assets are deleted automatically.
- **Lambda Function clears only changed files from the CloudFront cache**, reducing unnecessary cache invalidations.

### **Backend (Lambda + API Gateway + S3 + DynamoDB)**
- API Gateway processes **image upload requests**, using caching to reduce request costs.
- AWS Lambda functions handle image uploads, sharing, metadata storage, and **link shortening** in **DynamoDB**.
- S3 stores **both original and resized images**, with an **auto-delete policy** to manage storage costs.
- **DynamoDB is set to on-demand mode**, reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary provisioned throughput.
- **Lambda scales automatically** to accommodate sudden spikes in image uploads without manual intervention.

### **CI/CD (GitHub Actions + Terraform + tfsec + Infracost + CloudFront Cache Invalidation)**
- GitHub Actions automates **Terraform infrastructure deployment** without running persistent infrastructure.
- Any new code push triggers **automatic backend & frontend deployment**, reducing manual effort and costs.
- **Pull request authorization is enforced**, ensuring all changes undergo review before merging into production.
- **tfsec is integrated** into GitHub Actions to scan Terraform code for security vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Infracost is integrated** to provide cost estimation before deploying Terraform changes.
- **AWS Lambda function detects changed files and invalidates only those files in CloudFront**, preventing full cache invalidation.

- Go to **GitHub > Settings > Secrets** and add:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### **3️⃣ Submit a Pull Request for Code Changes**
- Push your changes to a **feature branch**:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 New feature implementation"
git push origin <feature-branch>
```
- Open a pull request in GitHub and request a peer review before merging.

### **4️⃣ Merge Approved Pull Request & Deploy**
Once the pull request is approved and merged to `main`, GitHub Actions will **automatically deploy** the backend & frontend:
```sh
git push origin main
```
- After deployment, the **AWS Lambda function will detect changed files and clear only those files from CloudFront cache**.

### **5️⃣ Access Your Deployed App**
Run:
```sh
terraform output
```
Then open:
```plaintext
